# Connect Four

Have you ever wanted to play connect four, but your friend is in Hell, MI while you're in Scratchy Bottom, Dorset? Or you're practicing zero waste but Connect Four is made out of pl\*stic??? Boy have I got a solution for you

## Shoot

Just add @ConnectFour#9004 to your Discord Server and let the ~~hunger~~ connect four games begin!

Fun fact: after a game starts it's locked to only 2 players, so those mean friends whom you hang out with only becase they buy you food can't boycott the game. Would you look at that.

Some funky comends:

```
!cf help - All info found here

!cf start [user] - Starts a new game between the one who send a message and mentioned user. During game, only users currently playing can start a new game

!cf [1-7] - During game, if it's your turn, you can use that command to place disc of your color into selected row
```
